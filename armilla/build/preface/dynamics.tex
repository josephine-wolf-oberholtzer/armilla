\section{Dynamics}

Dynamics are always in terms of effort, not effect. When bowing very
quickly and with strong dynanic, the effect should be a traditional
\emph{forte}. Likewise, when bowing slowly and with a light dynamic, the
effect should be a traditional \emph{piano}. Slow bowing with strong
dynamic should result in various colors of scratch, while fast bowing with
light pressure should give various qualities of flautando (depending of
course on where on the string the bow is contacting).
