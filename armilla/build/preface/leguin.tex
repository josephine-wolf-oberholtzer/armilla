\textit{The dunes ran inland, low and grassy, for half a mile or so, and then
there were lagoons, thick with sedge and saltreeds, and beyond those, low hills
lay yellow-brown and empty out of sight. Beautiful and desolate was Selidor.
Nowhere on it was there any mark of man, his work or habitation. There were no
beasts to be seen, and the reed-filled lakes bore no flocks of gulls or wild
geese or any bird. }
